    <h1>Renato,</h1>
    <p>
I've been thinking a lot. As a matter of fact, I don't think I ever stopped thinking. I dont know how else to approach you, or if you even want me to approach you still. <br>
<br>
I know I should have waited for my emotions to cool down before bringing them up to you. That way, I might have explained things more clearly. <br>
<br>
Even so, I was still wrong because I was creating made-up scenarios in my head and not seeing things as for what it actually is. <br>
<br>
I was unaware that I was making you feel bad and guilty all this time. That's why, I realized too late that the fight might have been too deep for you because you've been feeling that for a while. I wish you could have told me about them earlier, to call me out. <br>
<br>
I mean, in a way for me to realize that I'm making you feel bad because it's never my intention and I would literally set the world on fire before making you feel bad or hurt you.<br>
<br>
I've always had trouble setting my own boundaires and I didn't realize I was overstepping yours.<br>
I still have a lot to work on about myself but I am actively working on them now. <br>
<br>
I am genuine about you. <br>
<br>
But if up to this point I have somehow ruined things and have changed your perception about me, or about this (us), then I understand if you would rather go.<br> 
<br>
<br>
<i>Please don't get carried away by this half-assed site. I will respect your decision no matter what. If you need more time to think, please tell me and I will leave you alone and won't bother you until you approach me first. If you don't want to talk to me anymore, that's fine too. But please let me know and I won't bother you anymore. I promise. </i>
